# Java PostgreSQL Client

Non JDBC client for working with PostgreSQL.

It provides a lean & simple API without all the JDBC bells and whistles (overhead).  The API can be used for both blocking and non blocking clients, and a default JDBC thread pooled backed version lets you use it in the non blocking fashion.
